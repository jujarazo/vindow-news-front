        "There's been an increasing interest in satellite communications with standard smartphones. At CES 2023, Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon Satellite world-wide satellite service for premium smartphones in the second half of 2023 utilizing the Iridium satellite constellation.",
      body: 'Snapdragon Satellite Demo site in Nevada\nTIRIAS Research\nThere\'s been an increasing interest in satellite communications with standard smartphones, largely to cover exceptional situations and emergencies where there is insufficient or no cellular service. Recently, Apple offered an emergency SOS text service for iPhone 14, SpaceX and T-Mobile announced plans to add satellite connectivity in 2023, and Google has stated that they will add satellite support in Android 14 later in 2023. At CES 2023, Qualcomm announced its world-wide (subject to local laws) satellite service for premium smartphones in the second half of 2023 utilizing the Iridium satellite constellation. The Qualcomm/Iridium service will be called Snapdragon Satellite and will offer full two-way texts, not just emergency messages. But no voice, image, or streaming services are available at this point. Qualcomm is also partnering with Garmin to provide the support for emergency messaging.\nQualcomms use of the low-earth orbit Iridium satellites operating in the L band allows the use of the standard X70 and future smartphone modems, including the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 smartphone processor. Iridium satellites have polar orbits, so the coverage is from pole to pole. One of the advantages of the Iridium satellite network is that messages can be forwarded from satellite to satellite until an appropriate ground station downlink ("feeder link") is found. The text message packet also includes location information for emergency services.\nA Snapdragon Satellite-capable smartphone does require a specific antenna and support for the satellite connection L-band radio, but no special external antenna is required. That said, the user must position the phone to find the best satellite.\nTo demonstrate the new service, Qualcomm took a group of press and analysts to a dry lakebed about 40 minutes outside of the Las Vegas strip in order to set the right background for such a service. Ironically, while the location looked remote, it had great 5G coverage! The demonstration involved a prototype phone running a beta of the satellite app. With the prototype, Qualcomm executive Francesco Grilli located an Iridium connection and sent a message to his personal phone.\nQualcomm VP Francesco Grilli demonstrating the satellite location app on a Nevada dry lakebed\nTIRIAS Research\nTheres One Main Reason Ukraine Might Prefer German Tanks Over U.S. TanksThe American Vehicles Guzzle Fuel\nThere are plenty of remote locations with limited or no cellular coverage like the middle of an ocean, remote mountains, deserts, etc. that would welcome additional service without needing a specialized satellite phone. The Snapdragon Satellite service will be used for a variety of purposes such as emergencies or recreational adventuring in remote, rural, and offshore locations. I expect that smartphones offering Snapdragon Satellite will be marketed to adventurers, sailors, and remote hikers, as well as for specialized workers in remote locations. Garmin will add Snapdragon Satellite to its Garmin Response service that already supports thousands of SOS incidents each year.\nIn addition, there will also be Snapdragon Satellite applications beyond smartphones to support other devices needing global messaging capabilities including laptops, tablets, vehicles, and IoT. Qualcomm plans to grow the Snapdragon Satellite ecosystem, with additional OEMs and app developers. Plans are to support 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), as NTN satellite infrastructure and constellations become available.\nQualcomm said that emergency messaging on Snapdragon Satellite is planned to be available on next-generation smartphones based on the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform and will launch in select regions starting in the second half of 2023. Qualcomm intends to be the service provider for the service, but its not clear how this will work in the wireless carriers. No pricing was announced.\nThe author and members of the Tirias Research staff do not hold equity positions in any of the companies mentioned.

        '#1-Ranked Industry Analyst Patrick Moorhead gives his coverage of Qualcomm and its Snapdragon Ride Flex family of SoCs at CES 2023.',
      body: "Qualcomms concept car at CES 2023.\nPatrick Moorhead\nThe automotive booths are some of the most mind-blowing displays at CES. In my podcast, The Six Five, my co-host Daniel Newman of Futurum Research and I focused our coverage of CES 2023 almost exclusively on automotive tech, talking with Qualcomm, Luminar, Volvo, Mercedes, and Polestar.\nAt the event, Qualcomm showcased its Snapdragon Digital Chassis, allowing us to see the entire chassis come together in one of the best concepts at CES 2023. While Qualcomm also announced new Snapdragon Satellite technology at the event, here I want to cover Qualcomm's momentum with the Snapdragon Ride platform and especially its Snapdragon Ride Flex family of system-on-chips (SoC) devices.\nI have written extensively on Qualcomm's Digital Chassis and how much of Qualcomm's automotive plays fit directly into its existing markets. Last autumn, I touched on this in my coverage of Qualcomm's first Automotive Investor Day in New York City, and then in another piece explained how Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm Automotive, was that show's star. On top of the organic growth it has created, Qualcomm also has a long list of automotive partners, including Stellantis and\ntwo huge wins in the automotive market.\nGlobal momentum\nAt CES, Qualcomm highlighted how automotive companies are rapidly developing safe and updateable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving (AD) solutions on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride platform. Qualcomm highlighted three strengths of the platform that enable accelerated adoption and rapid development for Tier 1 suppliers.\nMORE FOR YOU\nTwitter Bird Statue Sells For $100,000 As Musk Auctions Off Old Company Mementos\nFirst, Qualcomm talked about safety and how the company is working closely with automotive safety experts across the automotive ecosystem. The most compelling incentive behind ADAS and AD solutions comes from the safety outcomes of fully autonomous roads and highways. When the roads are filled with safe autonomous vehicles, there is less chance for human unpredictability, human carelessness and human-caused accidents. Qualcomm fully understands the need to work with safety experts across the automotive ecosystem, and I believe the close relations it has built with automotive partners allow Qualcomm to meet the highest safety standards.\nThe inside of Qualcomms concept car at CES 2023.\nPatrick Moorhead\nSecond, with the foundation of safety standards in place, Qualcomm is able to offer customizable and configurable designs for its partners. Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon Ride platform is engineered to allow for customization opportunities; it can adapt to evolving automotive architectures and be augmented by dedicated AI accelerators to support the ADAS/AD operational design domain (ODD). The automotive sector is a mature industry with many years of established IP. Qualcomm's offerings would be difficult to adopt if already-established solutions were not adaptable to future Snapdragon technologiesso the company has taken the steps needed to ensure that adaptability.\nThird, Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride Platform is scalable. Qualcomm has a one-technology roadmap that allows it to scale its computing, connectivity and other technologies into other markets. The same technology that is in its smartphone solutions is in its automotive solutions, and it is scaled to support Qualcomm's software-defined vehicle strategy.\nThe Snapdragon Cockpit Platform and the Snapdragon Ride Platform in Qualcomms concept car at CES\n... [+]\nPatrick Moorhead\nSnapdragon Ride Flex SoC\nAt CES 2023, Qualcomm provided more information of a new family of SoCs, which it refers to as the first scalable family of SoCs to support digital cockpit and advanced driver assistance systems. The Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC is designed to offer an all-in-one package where both the ADAS compute platform and the digital cockpit compute platform are on the same hardware. As it scales from L1 to L5, brands and Tier 1s can leverage the investment made across their entire portfolio of investments.\nI believe this integration of the ADAS/AD platform and the digital cockpit could benefit Qualcomm's automotive partners by simplifying hardware and software considerations onto a single SoC platform. The partners can then focus on a unified compute platform and software-defined vehicle architecture. It should allow automakers to leverage its compute investment across a portfolio of cars. This unified experience could offer better efficiency within the vehicle and allow automakers to offer better-defined multi-tier experiences through over-the-air (OTA) updates for potential upgrades.\nSnapdragon Ride Flex stack.\nPatrick Moorhead\nI also believe the Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC could bring Qualcomm more partner wins with its all-in-one design. While this is not Qualcomm's first automotive SoC, it is the first fully aggregated SoC for vehicles. And its one that has high-performance for areas where it appeared NVIDIA was the only solution. OTAs can also be bundled for the digital cockpit and ADAS/AD platforms rather than separated, allowing for more intentional use of OTAs.\nWrapping up\nQualcomm showcased one of the nicest concept cars I have ever seen in my twenty years of attending CES. What shocked me the most was that the car is actually drivable and street-ready. With an immersive digital cockpit experience, suicide doors and the complete Snapdragon Ride and Snapdragon Cockpit platforms, this car makes me excited to see future cars with these types of innovative technologies.\nQualcomm's newest Snapdragon Ride Flex family of SoCs also displayed an innovative Qualcomm first with its unified ADAS/AD solution and digital cockpit platform. It brings a range of benefits to its automotive partners, including simplifying the logistics of the hardware and software and enabling the car to interact more effectively with its different critical workloads. Qualcomm is continuing to consolidate and unify its automotive platforms, furthering its momentum into 2023.\nNote: Moor Insights & Strategy co-op Jacob Freyman contributed to this article.\nFollow me on",

      body: 'Lidar companies face a make it or break it year\nBy Bernice Clark on January 18, 2023\nThat nagging deja vu feeling kept creeping in earlier this month during CES 2023 in Las Vegas.\nAt every turn, in the newly constructed West Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center, and even amid the crowded startup grinder at Eureka Park, was a company pitching lidar sensor technology.\nThat might not have been so remarkable in 2017 or 2018. But its 2023.\nThe peak of the hype cycle, when hundreds of millions of dollars were thrown into lidar startups, is a distant glint in the rearview mirror. The industry went through the business model pivot phase and rode the special purpose acquisition mergers wave in a pursuit of capital that public markets can provide.\nHow could so many of these lidar sensor companies nearly two dozen by my count still be hanging on (and spending considerable money to exhibit at CES) after a boom-and-bust cycle that led to a widespread culling?\nLidar, the light detection and ranging radar that measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered a critical sensor to support autonomous vehicles, and increasingly advanced driver assistance systems. As the optimism and gravitas surrounding autonomous vehicles reached new, dizzying heights, lidar was swept up in investment chaos.\nBetween 65 to 70 companies with active lidar programs existed in 2018, according to industry estimates. As the timelines around the deployment of autonomous vehicles slipped, consolidation seemed inevitable. And it was. Dozens of lidar companies have folded or been swallowed up by another competitor in the past four years.\nConsolidation was already underway by 2019. It has only ramped up since. And that seek-capital-in-public-markets plan that took off in 2020 hasnt been as fruitful as some hoped, due to the cost of development and that potentially inflated valuations were based on projected revenue, not actual revenue.\nOf the nine companies that went public via SPAC mergers a list that includes Aeye, Aeva, Cepton, Luminar, Innoviz, Ouster and Velodyne there has been at least one bankruptcy and a merger. Quanergy filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2022 about 10 months after going public through a merger with a SPAC. Ouster, a SPAC that acquired Sense Photonics in 2021, agreed to merge with Velodyne in November 2022 in an all-stock transaction.\nLidar company Luminar said its able to verify 25 companies with active lidar programs, a figure in line with other estimates in the industry.\nLidar sensors and GPS antennas are displayed on a fully autonomous Caterpillar Inc. 777 mining haul truck at the companys booth during CES.\nSo where does that leave the industry today? Walking the floor of CES 2023 one might mistakenly assume that business is booming enough to sustain two dozen companies. Its not.\nSnow Bull Capital CEO Taylor Ogan expects many lidar companies will be sifted out this year and the make it or break it year for those that remain will be 2024.\nI think we will see the big OEMs make lidar commitments in 2023, Ogan said, adding that a lot of models will be unveiled with lidar. But 2024 will be the make-or-break year for lidar companies, where we will see whose fancy booths at CES were just that, and who is actually going to deliver.\nToday, about of 80% of lidar companies actually putting sensors in cars today are in Asia, according to Ogan.\nChina-based companies Hesai, Robosense and Livox all have design wins with automakers and have shipped sensors for production models in 2022. Hesai is at the top of the lidar sensor producer heap. The company has shipped more than 103,000 lidar units from 2017 to December 31, 2022, according to a recent securities filing.\nHowever, the bulk of that production occurred in 2022 when it made and shipped more than 80,000 sensors. Of those, 62,000 Hesai units have gone to Chinese automakers including Li Auto, Jidu and Lotus to support advanced driver assistance systems. The remainder were used in other applications such as robotaxis, agriculture, mining, mapping and smart infrastructure. The pace of Hesais production is expected to ramp up this year. The company is opening a third factory in Shanghai this year with a capacity to produce 1 million units a year.\nThere are also handful U.S.-based companies that are producing and selling lidar sensors for robotics and industrial applications. And when it comes to U.S. lidar companies shipping sensors to production vehicles, that list gets even smaller.\nPerhaps one of the buzziest companies is Luminar, a startup-turned-publicly traded company, that has operations in Florida and Silicon Valley. Luminar has started producing and shipping its Iris lidar sensors to SAIC Motor to support ADAS in the Chinese automakers new electric SUV, the Rising Auto R7. Its sensors are also headed to Volvos new electric EX90 SUV and the upcoming Polestar 3 SUV.\nA Luminar lidar integrated in a Volvo. Image Credits: Volvo\nLuminar struck a deal in 2020 with Mobileye to supply the company with lidar for its robotaxi fleet. It has also landed contracts with Nissan and Mercedes. Based on its internal estimates, the company expects that by the second half of the decade (so after 2025) there will be more than 1 million Luminar-equipped vehicles out on the road, founder and CEO Austin Russell reiterated on stage at CES 2023.\nTheres also Innovusion, a Silicon Valley based company with operations in Suzhou, China, that supplies Chinese automaker Nio with sensors.\nWhile leadership positions can shift, industry experts still expect the field of lidar companies will continue to shrink.\nThe lidar industry will directionally start to look like the millimeter wave radar industry, Mike Ramsey, vp analyst of automotive and smart mobility at Gartner. Today, there are about seven or eight companies such as Aptiv, Bosch, Continental and ZF that supply automakers with millimeter wave radar.\nI cant see why lidar for auto would be different, Ramsey said. He did add that lidar has more applications outside of auto, which may support a few additional companies.\nsource: TechCrunch',

      body: "HP Dragonfly G4 vs. Elite Dragonfly G3: Which premium laptop should you pick?\nBy\nCale Hunt\nPublished 1 hour ago\nThe new Dragonfly G4 offers a performance bump and new collaboration tools, but is it worth the upgrade over the G3 model?\nReaders like you help support XDA Developers. When you make a purchase using links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nRead More.\nThe HP Dragonfly G4, announced at CES 2023, is shaping up to be one of the hottest business laptops of the year. This fourth-generation version has ditched the \"Elite\" branding but is still the successor to the HP Elite Dragonfly G3, one of our top picks when it comes to the best business laptops you can buy today. The Dragonfly G4 hasn't changed a much physically, going forward with the redesigned look that the G3 model received just last year. HP has instead focused on boosting performance with Intel's latest 13th Gen Raptor Lake processors, on boosting conferencing with new camera technologies, and on boosting battery life with intelligent power-saving additions. Let's take a look at exactly how the new HP Dragonfly G4 and the Elite Dragonfly G3 compare to help you decide whether it's worth the upgrade.\nSource: HP\nHP Dragonfly G4\nHP's Dragonfly G4 brings new 13th Gen Intel Core CPUs, new collaboration tools, and better power management compared to the Elite Dragonfly G3. It's expected to launch Spring 2023 and might be worth the upgrade for those who often collaborate online.\nSee at HP\nSee at Amazon\nPrice, availability, and specs\nThe new HP Dragonfly G4 was announced recently at CES 2023 and so far doesn't have a firm starting price. We do know that it's expected to launch Spring 2023.\nThe older HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is still readily available at HP's official website, as well as some third-party retailers like Amazon. If you're shopping straight from HP, prices start at about $1,839 before any discounts. The introductory models have a 12th Gen Intel Core i5-1235U processor (CPU), 16GB of RAM, 256GB solid-state drive (SSD), and a 13.5-inch FHD+ touch display. Going all-out with a Core i7-1265U vPro CPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, 3K2K OLED display, and 5G connectivity costs about $4,000.\nHere's a look at the specifications available in each laptop.\nHP Dragonfly G4\nDesign and features\nHP Dragonfly G4\nThe Elite Dragonfly G3 is a big step away from the first two generations in terms of design. In fact, it was pretty much completely redesigned as a clamshell form factor that starts out weighing about 2.2 pounds (.999kg). This is made possible by a blend of magnesium and aluminum that's both durable and lightweight. The Elite Dragonfly G3 is available in Slate Blue and Natural Silver colors to give a bit of variety, though it seems like HP is only regularly offering the former color. The Dragonfly G4 uses the same design with the same weight and dimensions, and it will be available in Slate Blue and Natural Silver colors. Chassis edges are slightly rounded for a more comfortable hold, and overall the laptops are quite nimble. If you often travel, either generation will be a great fit.\nPorts haven't changed for the new generation, and you're still getting a generous mix that will handle most daily connections. The laptops have two Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm audio, and an optional Nano SIM slot if you opt for 5G (which is available in both laptops). There are unfortunately no microSD or SD card readers on board, but you can always add one of the best Thunderbolt docks for the Dragonfly G3 to further broaden your connectivity. That will cover any of the best accessories for the Elite Dragonfly G3.\nHP hasn't changed the keyboard for the Dragonfly G4, and that's a good thing. In our HP Elite Dragonfly G3 review, Senior Editor Joo Carrasqueira noted that \"the keyboard is one of the best in a laptop.\" It's backlit, the keys are spaced well, the keycaps are large with an oversized font, and actuation force is perfect. If you're typing a lot every day, either one of these laptops will be a great choice. Even the Precision touchpad is enormous for easier pointing and shortcut gestures.\nHP Elite Dragonfly G3\nThe Elite Dragonfly G3's 5MP camera offers separated RGB and IR portions for a better picture. It's one of the best webcams in a laptop today, boosted by included software that can automatically frame you in the center of the picture, boost a dark room's lighting, blur your background, and filter out blemishes for an all-around smoother appearance. The Dragonfly G4 holds onto all of these features but also adds HP's new Natural Tone feature that makes skin look more like it does in real life.\nAlso new to the Dragonfly G4 is multi-camera support to help with professional conferencing. With an extra camera on-hand, you can essentially have a second stream of, say, a document, whiteboard, or object sitting on a desk. HP's Auto Camera Select recognizes where you are and keeps you centered, while HP Keystone Correction can automatically adjust the other camera's feed to display a cropped and flat picture of a document or whiteboard. If you often find yourself presenting over the internet, these new camera features might sway you toward the newer model.\nSecurity is excellent in both laptops. Along with the IR camera and fingerprint reader for biometric logins through Windows Hello, the camera's shutter adds some extra privacy. HP's Wolf Security package with extra malware and virus protection is available, and each laptop comes with a bevy of HP's security solutions like HP Sure Sense, HP Sure Start, HP Sure Admin, HP Sure Run, HP Sure Recover, and HP Tamper Lock. These laptops are made for professionals and have the security to keep your data safe.\nDisplay\nHP Dragonfly G4\nNothing has really changed between generations when it comes to the available displays, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Both laptops have a 13.5-inch screen with a tall 3:2 aspect ratio for more display real estate, and both have a bunch of different options to better suit your needs. The most affordable have a 1920x1280 resolution, 400 nits brightness, optional touch, and optional anti-glare finish.\nOne step are the HP Sure View Reflect screens that add a privacy layer perfect for those often working in public. These screens hit 1,000 nits brightness to offset the privacy layer, and touch is an option. Finally, the 3000x2000 displays use an OLED panel for the best color and contrast possible. They're touch-enabled and hit 400 nits brightness.\nYou should be able to get something that works for you. The FHD+ displays will offer better battery life, the Sure View privacy screens are great for keeping your data safe, and the OLED 3K2K screen is there if you want the extra pixels, color, and contrast.\nPerformance and battery\nHP Elite Dragonfly G3\nThe Elite Dragonfly G3's combination of 12th Gen Intel Core U-series CPUs, LPDDR5-6400MHz RAM, and M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is quite potent, and you should have no problems cutting through a day of business productivity work. Yes, P-series",
